# Ecolife

Ecolife is an e-commerce website. I am developing it for practice backend development. Please conseder the frontend design because design is not the main goal in this project. I just donwloaded a template from online. It has a lot of work left to do.
By the way the admin panel is a paid theme from themeforest.
